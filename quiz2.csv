FT,1,"Voltage and power across R1 will be unchanged.  R2 and R3 ,since in parallel should have same voltage drop.  With R2 decreasing current should increase to conserve.  And Vs should remain unchanged (the voltage and power associated with it)"CS,1,"As R2 gets smaller the total power in the system across the other elements decreases due to the fact that power is conserved so if more is going over R2 (path of least resistance), the other elements must be losing power."AS,1,"Vs will remain the same.  The power of R1 and R3 will increase to match what was lost with R2 decreasing to keep power through the circuit in equilibrium from where it started."JN,1,"The power associated with Vs, R1 and R3 will remain relatively the same.  Since Vs is an ideal element, it's power will remain unchanged.  And since the resistance values of R1 and R3 aren't changing, their power will remain unchanged."RM,1,"Vs will not be effected because it is an ideal voltage source and does not rely on current when outputting a voltage.  R1 will not be effected, because when the resistors are combined into a net resistance R1 is independent and simply 'adding on' to the resistance of the parallel combination of R2 and R3.  The power flowing through R1 will not change.R3 will be effected because it is wired in parallel with R2 and is mathematically bound to the R2 resistance.  R2 cannot change without changing the power flowing through R3 in parallel."JL,1,"Resister in series and parrall, voltage equals current times resistance, power equals current times voltage.  As R2 in decrease"BN,1,"The voltage source does not change in terms of power as it is a independent source therefore the power at Vs does not change.  The power at R1 is equal to that of the power at Vs because of the same voltage and current.  R3 increases from an increase in current.  As R2's resistance decreases the power found at R2 also decreases because of Ohm's law and the power law."JP,1,"The power of the circuit will not change because as the resistance of R2 approaches zero it begins to act like a short circuit which will cause the current to bypass R3 and will not change in value of the current through the circuit so the power through the circuit won't change.  Power equals voltage times current."DK,1,"Power equals voltage times current.  As R3 decreases toward zero all other elements will have to dissipate more power."MH,1,"The power will be divided by R1 and R2 and R3 or it better to say we have one big resistor.  In this case we have one big resistor which makes it easier to compute the other elements"JF,1,"As the resistance drops in R2 the current will increase in the current.  Ass R becomes smaller current will increase.  Voltage equals current times resistance."JE,1,"The other elements would remain unchange.  Since power is conserved the as R2 is lowered, the power of the other's is not affected."AC,1,"We know that decreasing R2 makes the current smaller, and thus the power of Vs and R1 will go down.  Also, the fact that R23 would decrease in value means that by using Ohm's law, both powers of R2 and R3 will also decrease."SB,1,"The power of Vs would remain the same because of power equals voltage times current.  The power of R1 would also be the same because it is in series and because power equals current times resistance squared.  But R2 and R3 would be affected because they are in parallel.  The power in R2 would decrease because of the lowered resistance, but R3 would become greater.  Based on the equation for resistor in series."AA,1,"The power goes from high to low. Vs source of power.  R1 disp.  R3 perelier so apsorbing power."EF,1,"As R2 decreases R32 will also decrease resulting in an overall lower resistance in the circuit."AM,1,"I know that R2 and R3 are connected in parallel so they won't have the same currents.  But, I would need to combine all my resistors first to find the total current.  After finding all the currents, figure out power equations before and after R2 (keeping in mind that power is supposed to be conserved but in this case, it's not)."CVM,1,"Power equals current times resistance.  R2 and R3 are in parallel.  The equivalent resistance in the circuit is R1 plus R23.  If the equivalent resistance is lowered Vs will increase, so the power associated with Vs will have to increase.  If Vs has to increase, then because Vs equals Is times the equivalent resistance, the the equivalent resistance will have to increase to keep the current the same.  This means R1 will have to increase and R3 will have to decrease."DB,2,"As the resistance of R2 decreases more power will flow through R2 than R3.  Vs and R1 will remain the same because R2 has no effect on either of them.  Electricity takes the path of least resistance so as R2 decreases more will flow through it than R3.  As R2 decreases it causes the equivalent resistance to also decrease between R2 and R3.  The voltage drop across R2 will be less therefore the voltage drop across R3 must be more considering KVL.  The total amount of voltage put into the circuit must drop before reaching the voltage source again."JoL,2,"The current and voltage won't change for Vs and so the power will be constant.  As is the case with Vs, the power of R1 will be constant also.  Due to Ohm's law, voltage equals current times resistance and the fact that R2 is in parallel with R3, the voltage of R2 must be equivalent to R3.  So, as it loses resistance, more current will need to flow through to keep a constant voltage.  Which means the power will increase in R2 as the resistance lowers.  For R3 the current and voltage will be constant so the power must also be constant."MM,2,"As the resistance of R2 decreases it becomes more and more like just a plain wire (ideally with zero resistance).  While R2 decreases the current threw R1 stays the same, the voltage source also stays the same so in turn the power of R1 and Vs stays the same.  But as the resistance of R2 decreases the power of R3 also decreases, this happens because R2 starts to act like a short circuit and all the current is flowing threw it.  So to sum it all up R1 and Vs do not change, R3 looses power and R2 gains power (power is conserved)."OR,2,"To start just looking at R2 and using power equals current squared time resistance as the resistance decreases it power will also decrease.  Next looking at R2 and R3 the resistors are in parallel meaning they can be combined.  If R2 decreases it makes the resistance of R23 increase thus increasing power at R3.  The finally looking at R23 plus R1 because they are in series, knowing that R23's resistance is increasing but R1 stays constant, R1's power will remain unchanged.  The voltage source Vs will remain constant and the current through will also be unchanged so its power will stay the same."AD,2,"As R2 decreases, the equivalent resistance of the whole circuit would decrease as shown in the equivalent circuit above.  So if the equivalent resistance decreased and the voltage had to stay the same the current would increase.  Voltage equals current times resistance.  Power equals voltage times current.  Power equals current squared time resistance."SD,2,"I can tell you that R2 and R3 are in parallel and R1 and R23 are in series but as for describing what happens to the power I have a hard time connecting everything together.  My guess would be that if R2 decreased while everything else stayed the same, that there would be less voltage drop across the circuit.  I don't quite know how to relate that to power other than power equals current times voltage, so maybe the power would be less or greater ..."CE,2,"Given that I know R2 and R3 are in parallel, I know that their combined resistance is less than the resistance of either of the individual resistors.  Decreasing the resistance of R2 will actually end up increasing the resistance in the circuit, therefore the current will go down.  We know that power equals current times voltage.  Voltage will stay the same because it is an ideal voltage source and therefore power will decrease.  Current may split differently on the parallel branches, but there should be an overall decrease in current across the circuit.  Power will decrease in each component."BE,2,"The power in Vs will be the same because it is a voltage source.  The power in R1 will be the same because Vs didn't change.  The power in R2 will increase because the current flows through least resistance and power equals current squared time resistance will be big.  The power of R3 will decrease because current will want to flow through the path of least resistance which is R2's path so current will decrease making power decrease."JH,2,"Since Vs is an ideal voltage source, this component will provide the same amount of voltage despite the current running through it.  Since R1 and R3 are two resistors running in series, and are unchanged, we can combine these resistances into one resistance R13.  R13 and R2 run in parallel, so their combined resistance gives us the total resistance of the circuit.  Decreasing the resistance of R2 will provide a higher resistance, causing a lower current running through it.  Because of this, the power will drop as well.  Voltage equals current times resistance. Power equals current times voltage.  Power equals current squared times resistance."HK,2,"The first thing I identify was that the resistors R2 and R3 are wired in parallel.  Therefore, they can be modeled as R23 for short.  Knowing this we can see that R1 and R23 are wired in series,  We can use this information to describe how the voltage behaves as R2 decreases.  As we know through Ohm's law, resistors absorb power due to the passive convention.  Because R2 is decreasing it will absorb less and less power which means the power associated with the parallel resistors R23 will decrease meaning R1 power will increase so that the power being supplied is equal."TS,2,"The total resistance is found by combining R2 and R3 in parallel and adding R1.  Vs does nothing different.  R1 has the same potential difference as before.  R2 is less resistive but the potential difference has to be the same so to make up for the loss in resistance.  The current is stronger therefore the power related to R2 increases due to the stronger current and the same voltage.  Power equals voltage times current.  R3 remains the same."RD,2,"Power equals current times voltage.  Voltage equals current times resistance.  R2 and R3 are in parallel and R23 is in series with R1.  As R2 goes to zero, R23 will decrease and so will the effective resistance in the circuit.  As power equals current squared time resistance, power is proportional to resistance, so power will also decrease."RG,2,"Voltage equals current times resistance.  Power equals current times voltage.  Power equals voltage squared divided by resistance.  The equivalent resistance is R1 plus the parallel combination of R2 and R3.   As R2 decreases the equivalent resistance increases.  R1 doesn't change the amount of power consumed.  The power supplied by Vs decreases because the equivalent resistance increases and power equals voltage squared divided by resistance.  The power of R2 increases and the power of R3 decreases."KJ,2,"The equivalent resistance is R1 plus the parallel combination of R2 and R3.  As R2 decreases, the total resistance, Req, will be less for the entire circuit.  Based on some circuit analysis, I say that R2 will be acting like a short, increasing in current intake.  R3 will draw less power, but the voltage will remain the same.  R2 will draw more power.  Power equals current times voltage, Vs will supply less power and R1 will remain unchanged."EH,2,"R2 and R3 are in parallel.  With R2 decreasing, there is less resistance and therefore the voltage will increase as voltage equals current times resistance.  Since power equals voltage squared dividied by resistance, there will be greater power through R2.  Since there is an equal voltage drop across R3 (parallel elements) as in R2 there will be an increase in power.  Since power is conserved and both R2 and R3 increase power consumption then power will decrease at R1.  The power of Vs will remain unchange as the current stays the same and voltage, power equals current times voltage."JM,3,"First look at the change that occurs on R2.  As the resistance decreases to keep the same voltage, the current (I2 in this case) rises.  Thusly the power through R2 increases.  When this occurs, knowing that I1 and I2 added together gives us the current in the source, the current in the source must increase through both R1 and Vs.  Keeping a constant voltage, however this causes both the power values for Vs and R1 to increase.  R3 however, because it's current is not directly effected in this case does not change and will remain with the same power consumption regardless of the decrease in R2."CR,3,"As the resistance of R2 decreases, more current will flow through it than before (current takes the path of least resistance).  Since power is directly proportional to current, the power associated with R2 will increase.  As the resistance of R2 decreases, less current will flow through R3 than before (current takes the path of least resistance).  Since power is directly proportional to current, the power associated with R3 will decrease.  Decreasing the resistance of R2 reduces the resistance of the equivalent resistor, which reduces the overall resistance of the circuit.  According to Ohm's Law (Voltage equals current times resistance), since the voltage source remains constant, the resistance of the circuit has decreased, then the current in the circuit must increase.  Since R1 remains constant but the current going through it has increased, the power associated with R1 increase.  The power of Vs remains the same."LM,3,"I will start by looking at equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel,  I know that power equals current times voltage and current squared times resistance.  When R2 decreases, Vs will dissipate more power to the circuit because there is less resistance allowing more current.  There is greater power dissipated in R1 and R2 but less power dissipated in R3."CD,3,"R2 and R3 are in parallel.  As R2 decreases this parallel resistance decreases.  The equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 plus R23 and so Req also decreases.  The total current increases because the total resistance decreases.  The power of R1 increases because the current increases and R1 stays constant.  The power of R2 goes down because the resistance of R2 decreases.  The power of R3 remains the same."TyA,3,"As R2 decreases the voltage across R2 will stay constant therefore by voltage equals current times resistance, R2 will start to draw more current and its power would go up.  This draw would also mean increased currents in R1 and Vs which both have their power go up.  R3 would remain unchanged because voltage remained constant and the extra current did not go to R3."SO,3,"The equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 plus the parallel combination of R2 and R3.   The power supplied by Vs would increase because as R2 decreases the total resistance of the circuit decreases. This is true, since the power of the source equals Vs squared divided by Req and Vs is constant for an ideal voltage source.  The power consumed by R1 would remain constant since its power is Vs squared divided by R1."KR,3,"As the resistance of R2 decreases, the total resistance of the two resistors in parallel also decreases.  I think of it as the pathway getting larger.  Using Ohm's law voltage equals current times resistance, when resistance decreases, current must increase to maintain the same voltage.  Power is directly related to current through power equals current times voltage.  So if current increases then all the powers of Vs, R1, R2 and R3 must also increase."MB,3,"The power at R1 should be unaffected by changing R2.  R1 is not affected as its current does not depend on R2.  The independent voltage source has a constant voltage and lowering the value of R2 just means more current will flow through R2 and less through R3.  Using this assumption if the current in R2 becomes greater and the voltage drop across R2 is unaffected, then the power of R2 (power of R2 = voltage of R2 times current of R2) will increase.  Using conservation of power, P3 will decrease.  This can be reinforced by I3 getting smaller (power of R3 equals current of R3 times voltage of R3)."MVM,3,"Since R1 is a component lying before R2, its power absorbed should be unchanged.  Since Vs is an ideal voltage source, its potential should be unchanged, but since the resistance of the circuit lowers as R2 decreases, the current should rise in response across R2, meaning it absorbs more power than before.  Because of KCL at node 1, the current across R3 should lower to compensate, therefore the power absorbed by R3 will be lower.  The power provided by Vs is unchanged?  Current and voltage from Vs are unchanged."PM,3,"First, I will find the Req for the circuit.  R2 and R3 are in parallel.  R1 is in series with R23 and so Req is R1 plus R23.  Looking at the circuit, we see that R1 will not be affected by most changes in R2 (R2 begin the exception).  As R2 decreases, it will become easier for current to flow across R2 and in turn will draw power away from R3.  Vs and R1 will not be affected until R2 hits zero.  Once R2 hit zero, R3 will be entirely circumvented, the total resistance will be R1."TiA,4,"I will start the problem thinking about how the Req will change if the resistance of R2 decreases.  First I will think about the power associated with Vs using Req.  I can see that if the value of R2 decreases then the value for R23 decreases.  Since R23 is in series with R1 if R2 decreases then Req decreases.  A smaller resistance means a larger current through the source.  This means from power equals voltage times current that the power associated with Vs will increase.  Along the same lines since the source current also flows through R1, the power for R1 (power equals current squared times resistance) will also increase.  There will also be more current flowing into the R2 and R3 parallel node.  Once again from power equals current squared times resistance, the power associated with both R2 and R3 will increase."DM,4,"The equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 plus the parallel combination of R2 and R3.  As R2 decreases in resistance the R23 parallel combination will also decrease.  Lower resistance means higher conductance, and therefore Req becomes lower.  As Req lowers, more curernt is allowed through the circuit, and the power absorbed by the resistors increases.  The power supplied by Vs also increases, and energy is conserved."EW,4,"As R2 decreases the current will increase through it's branch taking it essentially from the R3 branch as they are splitting the total current.  The power in R2 is the current in R2 squared times R2.  The resistance decreasing at R2 does decrease the power however since  it supsiquently linearly increases the current and the current is squared to find power the power dissipated in R2 increases.  Since there is less current at R3 but same resistance, power dissipated at R3 decreases but power at R1 will change slightly as will power at Vs because the effective resistance of the circuit will change changing the total current.  My guess is that is will lower the effective resistance increasing the total current increasing the power over Vs and R1."CVD,4,"R2 and R3 are in parallel.  If R2 decreases, this parallel resistance will decrease.  R1 is in series with R23 to give the equivalent resistance of the circuit.  The equivalent resistance of the entire circuit would decrease which means more current will be flowing through the circuit.  Remembering that power absorbed by resistors equals current squared times resistance and this power must equal the power supplied by the battery, all components must increase in power.  The source would supply more power and the resistors would absorb more power."RM,4,"R2 and R3 are in parallel.  The equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 plus R23.  As R2 decreases, the equivalent resistance of the resistor network decreases, increasing current from the power supply, and ultimately power from the power supply.  Since the current through the circuit increases, and R23 decreases, power absorbed by R2 will increase, power absorbed by R1 increases and power absorbed by R3 decreases.  The voltage divider circuit set up between R1 and R23 will have a larger voltage across R1 as R2 approaches zero."JN,4,"R2 is in parallel R3.  As R2 decreases so will R23, as this happens the total current in and out of the battery will increase, thus increasing the power of Vs.  This will also increase the power of R1 as power equals current squared times resistance for a resistor.  An increased current will cause a larger voltage drop across R1 which in turn causes the R23 voltage drop to decrease.  As R2 decreases in value more current will flow counteracting the loss in voltage meaning relitivly constant power for R2.  R3 will get less voltage and current meaning the power of R3 will decrease."TH,4,"Resistors R2 and R3 are in parallel and their combined resistance decreases as R2 decreases.  As R2 decreases the total resistance of the circuit decreases so is voltage is constant the current must change so voltage equals current times resistance.  Voltage is constant, resistance is decreasing so current is increasing.  Therefore, power equals current times voltage the power is increasing because voltage is constant.  If the power of the entire circuit is increased, then every element has to increase in power.  The power of R1, R2, Vs and R3 will increase."EG,4,"As R2 decreases, R23 will also decrease, meaning the equivalent resistance for the circuit will decrease, eventually becoming R1 because of the short circuit created if R2 goes to zero.  As R2 decreases the current will increase because of the equation current equals voltage divided by resistance.  This makes sense because there is less resistance impeding the flow of current.  So with the current increasing and resistance decreasing, both power equations show the power associated with Vs, R1, R2 and R3 should increase."LVF,4,"R2 and R3 are in parallel making R23.  The equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 plus R23.  As the resistance of R2 decreases the total current through Vs and R1 will increase corresponding to an increase in power for both elements.  The equations that show this are the power of Vs equals Vs time current and the power of R1 equals current squared time R1.  The current through R3 will decrease due to more current flowing through R2 and less through R3 than before.  This will result in a decrease in power for R3.  R2, being a linear element, will have a current increase through it corresponding to the decrease in resistance rendering the power the same."NA,5,"R2 and R3 are in parallel and the total resistance is R1 plus R23.  When R2 decreases, the total resistance of the circuit decreases.  This means the total current increases.  Since the power of the source is Vs times this current, the power of the source increases.  The power of R1 is this current squared times resistance.  Since this current increases, the power of R1 increases.  Since the current in R2 increases, the power of R2 increases.  Since the the current of R3 decreases the power of R3 decreases."RH,5,"Power equals current times voltage.  Voltage equals current times resistance and so power equals current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by resistance.  The equivalent resistance of the circuit R1 plus the parallel combination of R2 and R3.  So as R2 decreases Req decreases and by Ohm's Law, if V is constant and resistance goes down, current must increase.  Therefore, the power of R1 must increase because it sees more current.  As R2 decreases, it seems logical that more current would go through it so the power of R3 probably decrease while R2's power increases.  By similar reasoning to what I said about R1, Vs has more current through it as R2 decreases because of the drop in Req so it supplies more power."QH,5,"As R2 decreases, the total resistance of the circuit will also decrease.  Power equals current times voltage. Voltage equals current times resistance.  Power equals current squared times resistance.  As resistance decreases so does power, but individually, circuit elements may increase or decrease.  The voltage of Vs will stay the same but the current passing through it will increase as the equivalent resistance goes down.  Power will therefore decrease as the current increases but the voltage remains constant.  The power of R1 will increase because the resistance of R1 is constant but the current increases.  The power of R2 will change, but I don't know how because current increases and resistance decreases for this element.  The current in R3 will decrease because less current will go through it and its resistance remains constant."TR,5,"R2 and R3 are in parallel.  As the resistance of R2 decreases, the equivalent resistance of R23 decreases, decreasing the circuits equivalent resistance.  Since Vs is a constant, the current through the voltage supply increases due to ohms law.  Since power equals current times voltage, the voltage supply supplies more power.  R1 is in series with Vs so it has the same current.  Since power equals current squared times resistance, an increase in current increases the power drop through R1.  With R2 decreasing, R23 is responsible for a lower percentage of the total resistance, so it has a smaller voltage drop across it.  Since power equals voltage squared divided by resistance, less voltage across R2 and R3 decreases the power through them."
