JA,2,"R2 and R3 are in parallel so the voltage drop across each is equal but the current is not.  Then if I knew values I would calculate the new equivalent resistance between them, then R23 plus R1 because they are in series.  The I would use Ohmís law to find the new current in the circuit using voltage equals current times resistance.  I know all the elements are ideal and how resistor behave in parallel and in series, I also know Vs, R1 and R3 remain unchanged.  The next thing I would do is power equals current times voltage and because all resistors dissipate power, I would know Vs has to supply power.  At first glance, without doing any math, you could assume that a greater portion of the current entering into the node would go through R2 because itíd take the path of least resistance.  going back to calculating power I would also use power equals current squared times resistance so I wouldnít need voltage, but it would be useful to finding current so I would still use it."
WCA,2,"Vs is an ideal component, so changing R2 will not affect it.  R1 is in series with ìR23î so changing R2 will also not affect the power associated with it.  R3 will slowly have a decrease in power as R2ís resistance goes to 0, with R2 at zero coinciding with no power in R3.  R2 will increase in power, because the current is going to increase with a decrease in resistance.  So Vs is the same, R1 is the same R2 is larger and R3 is smaller."
AA,1,"First count the node and see what we have on parallel and series.  If R2 decrease current will goes to the low power resentment and then back to the course.    "
RA,2,"Since R2 decreases that means more current will go through R2.  That indicate that less current will travle through R3.  Power equals current squared times resistance.  Therefore, the power on R2, as R2 decreases, will increase.  The power of the source equals Vs times I1.  The power of R1 equals I1 squared times R1.  The power of R3 equals I3 squared times R3."
AB,1,"If the resistance of R2 decreases the power associated with R2 will go up because voltage equals current times resistance.  The resistance goes down so current has to go up, then power equals voltage times current goes up.  The power associated with R3 will go down because the voltage drop has to equal the rise of R2."
KB,2,"All of the current from Vs goes through R1 and then splits and a portion goes to R2 and R3 separately but it is conserved, so once it completes the circuit, all of the current released by Vs is back.  The power coming from the Vs will not change, however as the resistance of R2 decreases, it will be able to absorb power easier, so R3 will have less power associated with it.  R1 will have the same amount of power since it comes before R2.  So, the only one that will be changed by the resistance decrease in R2 will be R3."
JB,2,"I would start this problem by examining the cases if R3 at time equals zero and of R3 at time equals infinity.  We know that at R3 equals zero the element will act as a short and all power will be dissipated by R1.  We also know Vs is the only source in the circuit and that power of the source equals current times Vs.  Beginning at R3 equals R3, the voltage drop of R1 is at its lowest point.  Meaning R1 is using as much power as the power of R2 and R3.  R2 behaves in parallel to R3 and will dissipate less and less power as R3 approaches zero ohms.  This is because the current is decreasing while resistance is constant.  Power equals current squared times R.  When R3 equals zero ohms all power is dissipated by R1 and supplied by Vs."
BB,2,"Since the resistance of R2 goes down, more current will flow through that resistor.  This will cause R1 and R3 to absorb more current if possible because current is conserved in a circuit.  If the other two resistors are having to absorb more power (since resistors canít ever supply power), then the voltage source will be supplying power still.  The Vs might have to supply less power than before because of the sudden drop of resistance from R2 so that the other two resistors can handle the current.  Power equals current squared time resistance power and resistance are proportional so when one drops the other rises."
JB,3,"When the resistance is lower, the current increases.  As seen in power equals current times voltage, as the current rises, so does the power.  Thusly, the power is Vs rises.  Same is true in R1 where power equals current squared times resistance, as the current increases so does the power.  R2 and R3 work in parallel, meaning that their current varies but the power still rises.  Current equals voltage divided by resistance, as R gets closer to zero (without equal zero) current goes to infinity, meaning that less resistance means more current, and more current with a fixed voltage means more power."
NB,2,"As R2 decreases, voltage stays the same, so I2 increases to counteract the decreasing R value.  If I2 goes up then either I3 goes down or I1 goes up.  The power at R2 currently increases as well.  The power decreases at R3 due to decrease in I3.  The power increases at R1 due to increase in I1.  The overall current should not change so at Vs the power should remain unchanged.  This is due to conservation of energy in the circuit."
LC,3,"Since power equals current times voltage, the current flowing through the circuitry directly effects the power associated with each element.  By Ohmís law, if voltage is constant and resistance decreases, the current increases.  When R2 decreases, the total resistance of the circuit decreases and current increases.  When R2 decreases, the power associated with VS, R1, and R3 increases, but the power (current times resistance squared) associated with R2 decreases."
JC,4,"As R2 decreases, the sourceís current increases, and since Vs is constant, the power out of Vs increases.  Since this current also goes through R1, I can see what happens to the voltage drop as R2 decreases.  As the source current increases, the voltage drop across R1 increases, so the power dissipated in R1 also increases.  Since decreasing R2 increases current overall but decreases the potential difference through the parallel elements R2 and R3, it may decrease or increase the power through them."
SC,3,"From the equation for the total resistance of the circuit we can see that as R2 decreases, the whole denominator increases which means the parallel resistors will have less and less of an effect on the total resistance.  Using Ohmís law voltage equals current times total resistance.  We see that a smaller R2 will give us a smaller total resistance which will give us a larger current I, in the circuit.  If our I is larger we can see by the equation power equals current times voltage that the power across the elements should increase as the value of R2 decreases."
JC,4,"As R2 decreases, the sourceís current increases, and since Vs is constant, the power out of Vs increases.  Since this current also goes through R1, I can see what happens to the voltage drop as R2 decreases.  As the source current increases, the voltage drop across R1 increases, so the power dissipated in R1 also increases.

If our I is larger we can see by the equation power equals current times voltage that the power across the elements should increase as the value of R2 decreases."
HC,3,"As R2 decreases, the current will increase, meaning more power at Vs, R2 and R1, however since the resistance of R2 is decreasing, more current will flow through it.  R3 on the other hand remains the same, making R2 the path of less resistance.  With that in mind, I believe the increase in current will flow through R2 and leave R3 with the same current, meaning that R3 will have a steady amount of power."
AC,1,It would seem that as R2 decreases in resistance current increases (power equals voltage times current) and thus power increases at least in Vs and R3.
CC,2,The power associated with R1 will remain unchanged as the R2 value gets lower since it is after R1.  However the power associated with R3 will get lower as R2ís resistance decreases since they are in parallel as R2ís resistance decreases the current is going to choose the path of lower resistance.  If R2 kept decreasing the value of resistance it would eventually become a closed circuit and no power would go through R3.  Vs would also be creating a larger voltage and more current with a lower resistance throughout the circuit.
AD,3,"As the resistance of R2 decreases, the current across increases as the current across increases, the power dissipated increases.  By KCL, the current across R3 will decrease, so the power dissipated will decrease.  R1 will remain unchanged because it comes before R2 in the circuit.  Vs should also remain the same, since current should be conserved."
JD,3,"As R2 drops in resistance the equivalent resistance of the circuit decreases and therefore the overall current of the system increases making the power in other elements greater.  For example, since power equals voltage times current, the power associated with the source increases.  The drop in resistance of R2 causes less power in element R2 as well."
MF,3,"If R2 decreases then the total resistance Req of the system also decreases.  If the resistance in the circuit decreases, then the current throughout the system increases due to the relationship of the resistance and current in Ohmís law, that is, voltage equals current times voltage.  So if the current of the system increases, that means the power associated with VS,R1 an R2 increase as well due to power equals current times voltage.  If R2ís value decreases, then more of the current will travel through R2, rather than R3 because current travels in the path of least resistance.  Therefore, the power associated with R2 will increase.  The power associated with R3 will also increase because although more current flows through R2 compared to R3, the amount of the total current increases.  So R3 should also receive more current if R2ís value decreases."
DyF,2,"As the resistance of R2 goes down, R2 will begin to get brighter and R3 will become dimmer because current takes the path of least resistance so it will start to choose R2 more over R3.  R1 though will not see a difference unless volts or current is changed.  In terms of power, if R2 is slowly decreasing in resistance, and volts stay the same.  Ran out of time."
DaF,4,"As R2 decreases, the power associated with R3 would decrease since the current would decrease.  With less resistance down the R2 path would result in more current down the R2 path and less down the R3 path.  Since R2 decreases the combined resistance within the parallel circuit would decrease as well.  With R23 decrease the total resistance in the circuit would decrease.  With less resistance and Vs doesnít change voltage current would have to increase.  With more current the power with Vs would increase and the power with R1 would increase."
MF,2,"Power equals current times voltage.  Current equals voltage divided by resistance.  Therefore, power equals voltage squared divided by resistance.  The values of power within the different elements of the circuit will increase.  This is due to the overall resistance of the circuit declining."
TF,2,"As R2 gets smaller, R23 as a whole gets bigger.  The change in resistance gets bigger as a result.  Since power equals current squared times resistance and resistance is getting bigger, it would increase.  We forgot to take into account current squared which is controlled by voltage divided by resistance.  If resistance got bigger current gets smaller and therefore power decreases a lot faster.  After looking at how current squared and resistance are changed, I would say that the change in power in the system gets smaller."
NG,2,"We know that power equals current times voltage so in a series circuit current is the same throughout, except for parallel branch.  The first when we combine R2 and R3 we get R23 and to get the voltage drop across them which must be the same because they're in parallel.  To get equivalent resistance we use an equation that shows as R2 decreases the equivalent resistance will also decrease.  If the resistance decreases, when we solve for the voltage drop across using Ohm's law voltage equals current times resistance, the voltage will be less.  Therefore when we use power equals voltage times current the power will be smaller.  Summarized, as the resistor value gets lower, the current in the parallel circuit increases because lower resistance yields higher current, the power in R1 would lessen as well because voltage equals current times resistance, less resistance yields lower voltage and same with Vs."
ZG,5,"Will start by combining R2 and R3 into their equivalent resistance to determine the effect of Vs and R1.  As R2 decreases R23 also decreases.  This increases the current in the circuit causing the power associated with Vs and that associated with R1 to increase.  For Vs, power equals current times voltage and for R1, power equals current squared times R1.  As R2 decreases the square of i2 increases faster that R2 decreases causing power to increase for R2.  Decreasing R2 causes the voltage across R3 to decrease thereby current through and power consumption by R3 are also decreased."
GP,2,"Assuming the components are ideal, lessening the resistance in R2 will mean that the power associated with R2 will be greater as making the resistance less will make the current larger for current equals voltage divided by resistance.  As such the power will be greater as power equals voltage times current.  The power associated with Vs, R1, R3 do not change."
JF,1,As R2 decreases the power of R2 must increase.  This must be balanced by the rest of the circuit.  This will require more power to be supplied by the Vs and less power absorbed by R1 and R2.
SH,2,"I would start by simplifying the model slightly so that R1, R2 and R3 are combined.  As the equivalent resistance decreases it is seen that current must increase because the voltage remains constant.  This is found by applying Ohmís law and the equation for power.  The current through Vs and R1 would increase but would be the same across both components because the voltage remains constant and the equivalent resistance is decreasing, and would result in more power dissipated across them."
JH,2,"I would combine R2 and R3 into one because they are connected in parallel, R23.  Then I would next combine that resistor with R1 since they are connected in series.  So, if the resistance in R2 was affected it would affect all other resistors.  Current equals Vs divided by the total resistance.  Plug in the current just solved for in Ohm's Law into the power formula, power equals voltage times current.  Thus as R2 decreases it affects the total resistance, then the current, then the power.  Like a domino effect."
BH,2,"As R2 decreases it becomes an easier route for current to pass through, effectively lowering the resistance of the parallel components R2 and R3 when viewed in a simplified mode.  Power can be described as the current squared times the resistance.  In this circuit, R2 lowering would cause the total resistance to lower.  If the resistance were to approach zero (aka a wire) then the total resistance of the circuit would simply be R1.  Power is increased with higher resistance values, so when we lower the resistance (via lowering R2ís value) there is less power output. For Vs since resistance in the circuit is lowered, so there is a lowered power output.  For R1 resistance is unchanged, so power output stays constant. For R2 the lowered resistance causes lower power output, however current would increase due to the lowered resistance.  Power is squared so power output would likely increase.  For R3 the lowered resistance of R2 causes more current to flow the way of R2, rather than R3.  This causes lower power output."
ZH,4,"I will start this problem by thinking about the current.  When R2 is less than R3, its branch will progressively draw more current until it is basically a short circuit.  At that point R1 is effectively the only resistor, so it will draw more current meaning Vs has to supply more power and R1 has to dissipate more.  As R2 decreases, R3 will receive less current meaning that it will dissipate less power.  As R2 further decreases, more current will flow through R2, meaning it will dissipate more power.  As the current increases, R1 will have to dissipate more power and Vs will have to supply more."
CJ,1,"As the resistance of R2 decreases while the other component values remain unchanged, the power associated with Va, R1 and R3 will decrease."
JJ,1,"So we find that when R2 goes to zero, the equivalent resistance is left as one divided by R3.  This to me say that the resistance equivalent is reduced so it will take more power because as equivalent resistances is reduced by changing R2."
AK,4,"As the resistance of R2 decreases, the equivalent resistance of the circuit as a whole decreases as well, causing a greater current to leave Vs (voltage equals current times resistance, and the voltage of Vs remains constant).  Therefore, Vs supplies greater power (power equals current times voltage, the voltage of Vs remains constant).  Simultaneously, R1 dissipates more power due to the greater current flowing through it.  The voltage drop across R2 and R3 may be altered, but will remain equal as (they are in parallel).  As R2 resistance decreases, more current will flow through it as opposed to R3.  Therefore, the power dissipated by R3 decreases as less current flows through it and its voltage doesnít rise.  The power dissipated by R2 may increase, seeing as the current across it is increasing but its resistance is also decreasing (power equals current squared times resistance), but current affects power more."
AM,3,Voltage equals current times power.  As the resistance decreases the voltage decreases proportionally assuming the current through the resistance doesnít change.  The power associated with the voltage source increases because the current flowing from lower to higher potential increases and the voltage drop does not change because it is an ideal source.  The power dissipated by R1 would increase because there would be more current flowing through.  The power dissipated by R2 would decrease because having a resistor of lower ohms in parallel with it would decrease the current flowing through R2.  The voltage drop across R2 and R3 are the same and R3 will have more current through it causing R2 to dissipate less power than before.
JM,5,"As R2 decreases, so does the total resistance.  Voltage equals current times resistance.  As the total resistance drops, the current of the circuit increases.  The voltage of the voltage source remains constant because it is an ideal source.  Power equals voltage times current.  Because the voltage of the source is a constant and current is increasing as R2 decreases, the power of Vs, and R1 will all increase in magnitude.  As R2 approaches zero Ohms, less and less current goes through R3 as it is shorted out so its power decreases in magnitude."
RM,2,"Power equals voltage times current and also power equals current squared times resistance.  Now as the resistance decreases in R2 the current will increase and current is squared.  So the power disipated by R2 will increase and because the conservation of energy watts supplied equals watts disipated, R3 will dissipate less as R2 disapates more and Vs, R1 will provide / dissipate the same amount of power."
CM,2,"With Ohms Law we know that with decreased resistance and unchanged voltage, current increases.  So the power associated with Vs, R1, R2 and R3 increases using the equation power equals voltage times current and adding all of them together."
KM,2,"First thing I noticed was that a R2 decreases, the power through R3 decreases, the total resistance also decreases, so the total current decreases, and therefore the power through Vs and R1 decrease."
WN,5,"As R2 decreases in resistance the total resistance of the circuit decreases.  This in turn causes the current to increase according to current equals voltage divided by resistance.  Because current is increasing and voltage is fixed for Vs, power increases according to power equals voltage plus current.  Current in R1 increases as it is positioned to have the full current from the circuit pass through it.  Therefore, itís power also increases according to power equals current times voltage.  R3 is in parallel with R2 so that current divides.  As the current more easily passes through R2 current in R3 decreases causing the power in R3 to decrease and increase in R2."
AP,3,"As the resistance of R2 decreases, the value of the combination of R2 and R3 will decrease.  As a result the current will increase as current equals voltage divided by resistance.  The power will therefore increase for the voltage source."
MP,2,"The equivalent resistance of the circuit increases as R2 decreases.  As R2 decreases, the current would decrease through the other components.  The current through R3 would decrease the most since it is in parallel with R2.   Since voltage does not increase, the equation voltage equals current times resistance must still balance.  Since resistance increases, current must decresaae."
RP,2,I'm not sure how the resistance R2 decreases in this circuit but if it does I would assume that there would be more power available.  If R2 went from 10 ohms to 5 ohms you would have 3.3 Ohms.  The math shown illustrates that the total resistance dropped so more power would be available.
DP,5,"Starting with comparing R2 and R3 which are in parallel meaning they will have the same voltage drop.   Voltage equals current times resistance, so if resistance has to decrease it would therefore decrease voltage drop of R2.  This would therefore decrease voltage and power drop of R3 as well.  To look at the effects on R1 and Vs I will combine both R2 and R3.  This would always be smaller than the smallest resistance, so if R2 was to decrease it would decrease R23.  This would increase total current in the series and the voltage drop across R1 would be slightly higher.  Increasing power in both Vs and R1."
BQ,2,Power equals voltage times resistance and current equals voltage times resistance.  The power of the voltage source should therefore decrease with decrease in R2.  The power of R1 should remain the same since its voltage from Vs won't change.  The power of R2 should decrease since we are lowering its resistance.  The power of R3 should decrease in parallel with R2 which is decreasing.
BR,2,"As the resistance of R2 is decreased, the current through Vs and R1 will increase because when using Kirchhoff circuit law and substituting with Ohm's law, you will end up with an equation looking like current equals voltage divided by R2 which as R2 gets smaller, the fraction voltage divided by R2 will get larger in value.  Meaning current will increase.  Note: The voltage throughout the circuit will not change."
RR,3,"As R2 gets smaller more power will move through R2.  Because of this and KCL I know the power through R3 will decrease until when R2 = 0 then then the power of R3 will equal zero, as R2 will be a short.  As R2 decreases so will the total resistance of the circuit, this means the current will go up.  Given this the power across R1 and VS will increase."
KR,3,"Power is given by current times voltage and voltage equals current times resistance.  Because the two resistors are in parallel the voltage drop across these two elements remain the same.  As the resistance in R2 goes down the current through that element will increase due to Ohm's law.  The sum of the power supplied will remain equal through the resistor so since the current in R2 will increase the power supplied by Vs will also increase.  Since the voltage from the source is constant the current will increase thus increasing the power through R1, however the voltage and resistance will remain the same through R3 so it will remain constant."
KS,2,"If the resistance of R2 decreases, we know that the voltage drop across it will decrease due to Ohm's law (voltage equals current times resistance).  We also know that the power absorbtion will be less because power equals current times resistance.  This being known, energy must be conserved.  This means that more power will have to be absorbed by the other resistors in the circuit provided that the voltage source remains the same.  The power from the voltage source will remain the same, if all elements continue to function properly."
JS,2,First I will simplify the circuit by making R2 and R3 their equivalent resistance.  Then I will simplify the circuit down to just resistor by adding R1 and the parallel combination of R2 and R3 together.  Now that we have the equivalent resistance we can use that to find the current going through R1 and Vs using Ohm's law.  With this current we can find the voltage drops for R1 and the parallel combination of R2 and R3.  Because we know the voltage drops for R2 and R3 are the same we can use Ohm's law to find both of their voltage drops.  Then with those voltage drops for R2 and R3 we can again use Ohm's law to find the current through R2 and R3.  Now that we solved the circuit we can plug it into the power equation.
MS,2,"Power equals voltage times current.  Using Ohm's law to find current equals voltage divided by resistance. R2 and R3 are in parallel.  The parallel combination of R2 and R3 is added to R1 as they are in series.  Using Vs divided by the equivalent resistance, calculate current and then calculate power with voltage times current.  As R2 decreases the power should increase because current will increase as the resistance decreases.  As R2 goes to zero Ohms the equation for current becomes voltage divided by the sum of R1 and R3 and the power would have increased because current will be greater than current equals voltage divided by the equivalent resistance."
SS,2,"The power associated with R1 and R3 and Vs will stay relatively constant because the voltage and resistance has not been changed.  The power of R2 will decrease because resistance and power are directly related.  As resistance decreases, so will power.  The voltage drop and current will also be affected by the decrease in resistance. To solve the problem, I'd start by collapsing the circuit -- combining resistors 2 and 3 (since they are in parallel to each other) and add resistor 1 (since it is in series).  Then solve for the current and voltage drop at each node as I slowly expand back to the original circuit.  Then I have the values needed to compute the power at any point in the circuit."
CS,4,"Power is associated with voltage and current.  Voltage will not change, so a decrease in total resistance will increase the current through the circuit.  Vs will supply the same voltage but more power because the total current has increased.  R1 will dissipate more power because of the increase current.  As R2 decreases, the current passing through will increase and the power dissipated will increase.  R3 will receive less current because it is parallel to the decreasing resistance, the power dissipated on R3 will decrease."
PS,2,"As R2 decreases, its current increases because V=IR, and its voltage drop will remain the same.  If I2 increases, it draws the extra current from what would've traveled through R3.  Since R3 is getting less current, its power decreases because power equals current squared times R.  As R2 decreases, the equivalent resistance increases.  If the total resistance increases than the net current decreases.  The net current runs through R1, so if that decreases, the power associated with R1 also decreases.  If this is the case, the power associated with the voltage source also decrease, because if the circuits components are absorbing less power, the circuit also supplies less power."
NT,3,"Power equals current times voltage and current equals voltage divided by resistance.  As R2 gets smaller, the total resistance of the circuit gets smaller, therefore the current gets larger, meaning the power increases."
DT,3,"Power equals current times voltage or current squared times resistance.  Since we are assuming that all elements are ideal, we can assume the the voltage source will not change throughout the process.  Because of this, we can move on to examining the rest of the circuit with minimal regard for Vs.  Now, what happens when R2 is decreased is that the current associated with it, as well as that of the whole system, changes.  We can assume that the total current of the system will increase per Ohm's Law, and in turn the total power of the system will increase as power equals voltage times current. and because we know that voltage is constant.  Since we know that resistors always absorb power, this means that the voltage source will be supplying power increasing power as R2 decreases.  From here, we can then apply KVL and KCL to find the powers associated with R1, R2 and R3, but suffice it to say that these values will also change as R2 decreases."
BW,2,"Start by combining R2 and R3 to realize the current wonít change through R1, but the voltage drop across R1 will increase.  The power through R1 increases, because the same current passes through it with higher potential difference.  Then split R2 and R3 and find the voltage drop across each.  Vs would stay the same power wise because it is independent from the other elements of the circuit.  R3 power would stay the same along with R2, because as you decrease resistance in R2, more current will pass through it, keeping the power the same.  And R3 will have less current than before, but the voltage will be higher than R2, meaning their power."
LW,3,"While R2 decreases, there will be an increase of current through VS, R1 and R2.  R3 however will not have increased current because the voltage drop and resistance remain constant, therefore current will not change.  Since the total resistance is reduced, there will be more current flowing through VS and R1.  Because of this increased current and unchanged voltage, power will increase by power equals voltage times current."
AW,2,As R2 goes down voltage will remain the same and current will get higher in due to less resistance meaning higher power due to power equals current times resistance with more current.  Because more current is being used on the other direction of node 2 less current will go through R3 direction due to KCL meaning voltage will also be lower due to voltage equals current times resistance over changing power to be similar.  Vs and R1 due to voltage unchanged the voltage and current at node 1 and R1 will not have changed meaning no change in power.
CZ,2,"To start this problem I will look at what resistors are in parallel and which are in series.  As R2 decreases R1 will remain unchanged as will R3 and the Vs.  However the equivalent resistance will change in many ways due to the parallel resistorís relationship.  As R2 decreases its voltage drop will decrease as well.  Now, Iím thinking that since its voltage drop will change, Vs will also decrease because R23 will have a different value and may not dissipate all the energy in the system.  The only things that will not change as R2 decreases it R1 and R3ís resistances.  But the equivalent resistance and Vs will change depending on R2ís value in the circuit.  If Vs did not change the resistors wouldnít be able to dissipate all the power that would be required of them."
CZ,3,"Vs and R1 are going to share the same current as they are both in series and the potential difference of both items are unchanged the power associated with them is constant.  Because R2 and R3 are in pararallel the voltage of each are equal even when R2 drops, however the total voltage will be lower in each resistor as their combined resistance drops and current will change as well.  The power with both R2 and R3 will lower."
